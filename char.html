    <div class="col-sm-6 jumbotron  "><h1>HARRY POTTER</h1>
    	<p>Perhaps it's a given that Harry Potter himself tops our list, but it's important to still reflect on why the character has been so universally accepted. He's a sympathetic figure; a kid plucked from unfortunate circumstances and thrust into a magical reality. He realizes he has been gifted with great power. And then he's pitted against the ultimate evil in the wizarding world, Lord Voldemort, who years ago killed his mother and father . Everybody loves an underdog story of good vs. evil and we've watched Harry grow up in this fantastic setting -- forming friendships, fighting foes, and finding love.<br>While Harry only partially realizes his deepest desire, to see his dead parents again, he is fathered and mothered by the care-taking adults who surround him -- Albus Dumbledore, Hagrid, Molly and Arthur Weasley, and Sirius Black to name a few.</p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6  jumbotron"><h2>HERMIONE GRANGER</h2>
      <p>Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley's best girl-pal, is so much more than just a token throw-in for female readers/viewers to identify with. In fact, she narrowly edges out Ron for second place on our list. Why? We're glad you asked... Potter author J.K. Rowling describes her as "very logical, upright, and good." And while she's at first painted as a brainy do-gooder who always plays by the rules, it's fun to watch Hermione develop into so much more over the course of the series.<br>Throughout the novels and films, Hermione remains the voice of reason, but she'll break the law without hesitation if it's for the greater good. And her Spock-like logic is no help at all when hormones come into play -- completely fracturing, in fact, when it comes to her playfully love-hate relationship with Ron. You'll find no better friend or magical ally than "the brightest witch of her age."</p></div>
</div>
<div class="row ">
    <div class="col-sm-6 jumbotron "><h2>Ron Weasley</h2>
      <p>Ron Weasley is Harry Potter's best friend and ever-present sidekick. But unlike most sidekicks, Ron isn't a coward or a simpleton, nor is he content to live in Harry's shadow. Of the three friends that make up the main cast of characters, Ron is the comic relief -- not an uncommon trait for sidekicks of his ilk -- a characteristic that makes him instantly endearing. And while he lacks Harry's natural magical talent, or Hermione's smarts, Ron overcomes his shortcomings with faithfulness and perseverance.<br>n spite of his fear of spiders, Ron follows Harry loyally into the Forbidden Forest, and mixes it up with the bad guys more than a few times in the series. He goes from bumbling Gryffindor keeper to Quidditch hero and works undercover at Hogwarts to co-found the vigilante student group Dumbledore's Army. Ron's flirtation/frustration with Hermione is also a highlight of the series.</p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6  jumbotron"><h2>Albus Dumbledore</h2>
      <p>For a character that was introduced into popular culture only in recent years, it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore has already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and film. Like Gandalf and Yoda before him, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore plays the role of wise sage, guide, and pseudo-grandfather in the story.<br>There's a whimsical eccentricity to Dumbledore that might mislead some into thinking he's a kind of absent-minded professor. That would be a mistake as he's proven to be one of the most skilled wizards that ever lived. In the films, we loved Richard Harris' more soft-spoken approach early on, but have to admit that Michael Gambon felt right at home showing Dumbledore at his most impressive – from taking on Voldemort in a one-on-one battle, to single-handedly thwarting off a horde of zombie-like Inferi.</p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6 jumbotron "><h2>Severus Snape</h2>
      <p>Whether you love him, or hate him, or love to hate him, Severus Snape makes quite an impact in the Harry Potter series. If you're Harry, Snape is a nightmare of a teacher – picking on the boy from the moment he stepped into Potions class, and showing clear favoritism toward Draco Malfoy and other Slytherin students. And yet… When Harry and his friends thought Snape was the one trying to steal the Sorcerer's Stone, it turned out he was trying to protect it, and every now and again, Snape actually seemed like he was trying to help these kids.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6  jumbotron"><h2>Hagrid</h2>
      <p>For a boy like Harry, who grew up without any friends, a big warm and fuzzy brute like Hagrid couldn't have busted down the door at a better time. And a true friend he was. When others among the staff at Hogwarts were quick to skewer Harry with insults or shrug off his queries with mysterious glares, Hagrid was always there as a true confidant. It's always helpful to have a big lug on the payroll who's got your back, even if he is a bit of a well-intentioned klutz.<br>Hagrid's most powerful and emotional moments still resonate because of his history with Harry, Hermione and Ron. He's the surrogate for us, the audience, as we watch our favorite students mature and develop into young warriors. The short scene in Goblet of Fire, when he walks through the woods with our heroes, recollecting favorable times with the three of them, gave us all a cherished memory.</p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6  jumbotron"><h2>Sirus Black</h2>
      <p>"Have you seen this wizard?" "Approach with extreme caution!" "Notify immediately by owl the Ministry of Magic." So read the wanted posters plastered everywhere in the wizarding world upon Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban prison, where he'd been sent years earlier for the murder of 12 Muggles and aiding Lord Voldemort. But Sirius is an innocent man. And it's after he is vindicated that the character truly comes alive.<br>Sirius was a close friend of James and Lily Potter, so much so that they named him as Harry's godfather. And while he maintains a sort of edgy, rebellious appeal -- emitting a truly badass vibe at times</p></div>

   <div class="col-sm-6  "><img class="img-responsive"  src="dobby.jpg"></div>
    <div class="col-sm-6  jumbotron"><h2>Dobby</h2>
      <p>Such a beautiful place... to be with friends." It's difficult to not get a bit misty-eyed recalling the moment when Dobby the house-elf said those words in Deathly Hallows Part 1, which were among his last. When we met Dobby, admittedly, he was pretty annoying. He was a strange, little creature with a habit of hurting himself, who made things very difficult for Harry Potter as he began his second year at Hogwarts. But Dobby's intentions were always noble, and his determination to help Harry, despite the short term consequences, was commendable.<br>Dobby's role in the film series is far smaller than in the books, where he made frequent appearances in-between Chamber of Secrets and Deathly Hallows. In the books, we saw more of how kind-hearted and loyal Dobby was, particularly towards Harry Potter, to whom he was indebted for his freedom.</p></div>

    <div class="col-sm-6  jumbotron"><h2>voldemort</h2>
      <p>The greatest thing about Lord Voldemort (AKA Tom Marvolo Riddle) was that he was rotten to his very core. There would be no redemption for such a wicked spirit. There was never any "good" lying dormant underneath Voldemort's dark exterior. He was never corrupted as a child; he was the corrupter. When other powerful sorcerers don't even have the cajones to speak your name, then you know you've truly arrived as the ultimate master of malice.<br>As the most sinisterly popularized villain since Darth Vader, Voldemort was truly frightening. In book after book, Harry managed to evade certain death only by the skinny skin of his teeth. We literally could not figure out a way that Harry, as cunning as he was, could ever defeat such a powerfully evil force. Voldemort might not have been able to comprehend love or friendship, but that certainly didn't stop us from taking delight in such a devilishly dreadful dude.</p></div>
